<h1>Maintainers & Escalation</h1>

<p>
InfraForgeLabs is currently stewarded by a single founder maintainer.
</p>

<p>
Governance documents exist to ensure that as contributors and maintainers
join in the future, core principles remain protected.
</p>

<h2>Key Rules</h2>

<ul>
  <li>One codebase for all users</li>
  <li>No feature gating or paid-only execution paths</li>
  <li>No license bait-and-switch</li>
  <li>No forced cloud dependencies</li>
</ul>

<p>
Clear escalation rules ensure that decisions affecting trust or monetization
are reviewed carefully and transparently.
</p>
