  <h3>Is this really free?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. InfraForge Labs tools are free to use for learning and local execution.
    You can run them offline without subscriptions or cloud dependencies.
  </p>

  <h3>Is this open source?</h3>
  <p>
    No. The source code is proprietary and not publicly distributed.
    This allows InfraForge Labs to remain sustainable, consistent, and
    professionally maintained over the long term.
  </p>

  <h3>Why do paid plans exist?</h3>
  <p>
    Paid plans support continued development and unlock professional features
    such as advanced insights, team usage, and extended tooling.
    Core functionality remains free to use.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I use this commercially?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. Commercial use is allowed under the InfraForge Labs license terms.
    Redistribution, resale, or hosted offerings may require a separate agreement.
  </p>

  <h3>What happens if I stop paying?</h3>
  <p>
    Nothing breaks. Any locally installed tools continue to work.
    Paid features simply become unavailable until the license is renewed.
